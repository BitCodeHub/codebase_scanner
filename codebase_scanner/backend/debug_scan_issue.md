# Debugging "No scan data found" Issue

## The Problem
When you navigate to a scan results page like `/scans/d0a2edc8-a5de-4980-a071-92931b8af013/results`, you see "No scan data found" even though the scan appeared to complete successfully.

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. **Scan ID Mismatch**
- The backend was generating a UUID for the scan
- But the database uses BIGSERIAL which auto-generates numeric IDs
- The scan results were trying to link to the UUID, not the actual database ID
- **Fixed**: Now we use the database-generated ID

### 2. **Invalid scan_type**
- The code was using "mobile_security" as scan_type
- But the database enum only allows: 'security', 'quality', 'performance', 'launch_ready', 'full'
- **Fixed**: Changed to use 'security'

### 3. **Severity Case Mismatch**
- The code was storing uppercase severity (CRITICAL, HIGH)
- But the database enum expects lowercase (critical, high)
- **Fixed**: Convert to lowercase before storing

### 4. **Response ID**
- The API was returning the UUID in the response
- But the frontend needs the actual database ID to navigate to results
- **Fixed**: Return the database-generated ID

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check if your scan exists in the database:
```bash
cd backend
python test_scan_database.py d0a2edc8-a5de-4980-a071-92931b8af013
```

This will show if the scan exists and has results.

### 2. For new scans after the fix:
- Create a new project
- Start a scan
- Note the scan ID returned
- Navigate to the results page
- You should now see the scan results!

### 3. If you still see issues:
Check the browser console for errors and the network tab to see what data is being fetched.

## What happens now

After Render redeploys with these changes:
1. New scans will properly store results in the database
2. The scan ID returned will match what's in the database
3. The frontend will be able to fetch and display scan results
4. You'll see actual vulnerabilities instead of "No scan data found"

## Note about existing scans
Scans created before this fix may still show "No scan data found" because they were created with the wrong ID structure. New scans created after the deployment will work correctly.
