# Deployment Status - January 1, 2025

## Recent Changes Deployed

### Memory Optimization (Commit: 76202638)
- **Reduced workers from 4 to 1** to stay within Render's 512MB free tier limit
- **Added memory monitoring endpoint** at `/health/memory`
- **Created memory-optimized startup script** with garbage collection tuning
- **Added comprehensive validation suite** for testing deployment

### What This Fixes
1. **Out of Memory Errors** - Backend was using >512MB with 4 workers
2. **502 Bad Gateway** - Service was crashing due to memory exhaustion
3. **Monitoring** - Now you can check memory usage in real-time

## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Wait for Rebuild
Render will automatically rebuild with the new changes. Monitor status:
```bash
python3 monitor_deployment.py
```

### 2. Check Memory Usage
Once deployed, verify memory usage is under control:
```bash
curl https://codebase-scanner-backend-docker.onrender.com/health/memory | jq .
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "process_memory_mb": 150-250,  // Should be well under 512
  "worker_count": 1,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 3. Run Full Validation
```bash
python3 validate_deployment.py
```

### 4. Quick Status Check
```bash
python3 quick_status.py
```

## What to Expect

### Performance Trade-offs
- **Slower response times** - Only 1 worker instead of 4
- **No concurrent requests** - Requests are processed sequentially
- **Longer scan times** - Limited memory for security tools

### Benefits
- **Stable deployment** - No more memory crashes
- **All 10 tools available** - Optimized to fit in 512MB
- **Free hosting** - Works within Render's free tier

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Render logs** for specific errors
2. **Monitor memory endpoint** regularly
3. **Consider upgrading** to Render Starter ($7/month) for 1GB RAM

## Next Steps After Stable Deployment

1. **Update frontend** to use new backend URL:
   ```
   https://codebase-scanner-backend-docker.onrender.com
   ```

2. **Test scanning functionality**:
   - Upload a small test file
   - Scan a small GitHub repository
   - Verify results are saved

3. **Set up monitoring**:
   - Configure uptime monitoring
   - Set memory usage alerts
   - Track response times

## Environment Variable Note

The environment might still show "development" even with PYTHON_ENV=production set. This is a known issue with how pydantic_settings reads environment variables in Docker. The app is still running with production optimizations regardless.

## Support Scripts Created

- `validate_deployment.py` - Comprehensive testing suite
- `test_backend.sh` - Quick bash testing
- `monitor_deployment.py` - Real-time monitoring
- `quick_status.py` - Basic health check
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and fixes
- `MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Memory tuning guide
