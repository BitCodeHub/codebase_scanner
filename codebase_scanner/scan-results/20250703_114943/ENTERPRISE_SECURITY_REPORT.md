## 9. Technical Recommendations

### 9.1 Immediate Security Controls

1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
   ```nginx
   # Nginx security headers
   add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
   add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
   add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
   add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   ```python
   from flask_limiter import Limiter
   
   limiter = Limiter(
       app,
       key_func=lambda: get_remote_address(),
       default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
   )
   ```

3. **Input Validation Framework**
   ```typescript
   import { z } from 'zod';
   
   const UserInputSchema = z.object({
     email: z.string().email(),
     password: z.string().min(12).regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])/),
     username: z.string().min(3).max(20).regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/)
   });
   ```

### 9.2 Security Architecture Improvements

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Implement micro-segmentation
   - Service mesh for internal communications
   - Mutual TLS for service-to-service

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple security layers
   - Redundant controls
   - Fail-secure mechanisms

3. **Security Monitoring**
