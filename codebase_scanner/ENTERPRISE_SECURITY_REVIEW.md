## üîç Critical Security Findings

### 1. **Hardcoded Secrets (14 instances)**
- Generic API keys in documentation
- Stripe test tokens exposed
- Supabase keys in setup instructions
- **Risk**: High - Potential unauthorized access
- **Action**: Move all secrets to environment variables

### 2. **Docker Security (1 instance)**
- Missing USER directive in Dockerfile
- **Risk**: Container runs as root
- **Action**: Add non-root user to Dockerfile

### 3. **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (2 instances)**
- tarfile.extractall() without validation
- res.sendFile() with user input
- **Risk**: Arbitrary file access
- **Action**: Implement path validation and sandboxing

### 4. **Command Injection Risk (1 instance)**
- child_process usage with user input
- **Risk**: Remote code execution
- **Action**: Sanitize inputs or use safer alternatives

### Security Hardening:
- [ ] Implement input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Set up WAF rules for common attacks
- [ ] Configure automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all security events

### Monitoring & Compliance:
- [ ] Set up real-time security monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting for suspicious activities
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Schedule regular security audits
- [ ] Document security procedures
